# Branching Strategy & Suggestions

## Developing a feature or fixing a bug? Look here

Please start a feature branch off of the develop branch to begin your work.

The feature branch naming strategy is: item_type/item_number/description

For example: feat/1273/adding_prop_to_starships, or bug/283384/starships_display_all_props

item_types: feat, bug, or chore

## Ready to PR? Look here

The Master branch is the live version of our app, and is protected in the remote repository. Pull Requests are required to push any code to master. 

Complete the work on your feature branch. Push that to develop. Open a Github PR from develop to master, and then complete it!
